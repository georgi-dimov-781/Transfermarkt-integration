/**
 * @file
 * Template for displaying the team squad list from Transfermarkt.
 *
 * This template is used by the TeamSquadController to display the complete
 * squad from Transfermarkt for a team. It shows all players from the API
 * and provides buttons to import individual players.
 *
 * Players that have already been imported are highlighted and have a "View player"
 * button instead of an "Add player as node" button. This allows administrators
 * to selectively import only the players they need instead of importing the
 * entire squad at once.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - team_name: The name of the team.
 * - team_id: The Transfermarkt ID of the team.
 * - team_nid: The node ID of the team.
 * - squad_players: Array of squad player data from the API.
 * - imported_players: Array of already imported player IDs, keyed by Transfermarkt ID.
